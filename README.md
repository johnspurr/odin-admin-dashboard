# Admin Dashboard
Admin Dashboard project for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to get used to CSS Grid. As a result it used CSS Grid even where it might not actually be necessary or where it's even a little awkward.

I also took the opportunity to try out some better CSS organization by using BEM classes.

And I also started to look into accessibility stuff including aria labels and semantic HTML but it wasn't a whole-hearted effort due to this just being a mockup and me wanting to finish the meat of the project and move on to the next lessons.
